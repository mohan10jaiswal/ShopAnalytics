# ShopAnalytics

##  Output
ShopAnalytics is a data-driven analytics project that processes and visualizes sales data. The project aims to provide insights into business performance, trends, and optimization strategies.

##  Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python** (for data processing & analysis)
- **Pandas, NumPy**  (data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (visualization)
- **KNIME** (ETL processing)
- **Tableau / Power BI** (data visualization & reporting)
- **Apache Airflow / dbt** (ETL pipeline automation)
- **SQL** (data storage & querying)

## Steps to Implement

### 1 Data Acquisition
- Collected raw sales data in CSV format.
- Moved CSV files into the project directory.

### 2️ Installation
- Install the required dependencies:
  ```sh
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
  ```
- Install KNIME for ETL processing.
- Set up Tableau / Power BI for visualization.

### 3 Connecting Data
- Loaded the CSV files into a **pandas DataFrame**.
- Connected KNIME / SQL database for further processing.
- Integrated Tableau / Power BI for interactive dashboards.

### 4 Data Processing & Analysis
- Cleaned and transformed raw data using Python & KNIME.
- Built sales performance reports and trend analysis.
- Automated ETL pipeline with Apache Airflow or dbt.

### 5️ Visualization & Reporting
- Designed dashboards in Tableau / Power BI.
- Created interactive charts and KPIs for business insights.

##  Future Enhancements
- Deploy the project to the cloud (AWS/Azure/Snowflake).
- Implement machine learning models for sales prediction.
- Optimize data pipelines for real-time analytics.
